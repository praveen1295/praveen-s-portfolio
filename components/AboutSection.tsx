              Hi, my name is Praveen and I am a{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">{"highly ambitious"}</span>,

            <br />
            <p>
              I graduated from VITS College, Indore, in 2017 with a
              Bachelor&#39;s degree in Mechanical Engineering. After my
              engineering, I pursued a Full Stack Web Developer course from
              Newton School, which I completed in October 2022. Since then, I
              have been working as a Software Engineer, combining my technical
              knowledge and passion for coding to create meaningful solutions.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              My life is a blend of diverse interests, from reading and playing
              sports to traveling and exploring new horizons. I thrive on new
              experiences and am continuously engaged in learning.
            </p>

              I firmly believe in the philosophy of perpetual growth. With a
              passion for technology, I constantly strive to push the boundaries
              of what is possible. I am excited about the journey my career is
              on and am always open to new and exciting opportunities. ðŸ™‚
